**RLAXY - Relaxing Tea Web Project**

RLAXY is a fictional minimalist tea brand concept inspired by cozy cafe aesthetics. This web-based prototype was developed to demonstrate the full-stack front-end skills involving HTML, CSS, and basic JavaScript, with PHP and MySQL integration for dynamic data handling (to be added in next development phase).
